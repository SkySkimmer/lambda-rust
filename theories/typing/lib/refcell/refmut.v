Section refmut.
  Context `{typeG Σ, refcellG Σ}.

  (* The Rust type looks as follows (after some unfolding):

     pub struct RefMut<'b, T: ?Sized + 'b> {
       value: &'b mut T,
       borrow: &'b Cell<BorrowFlag>,
     }

     In other words, we have a pointer to the data, and a pointer
     to the refcount field of the RefCell. *)
